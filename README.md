# todoTemplate

This repo contains HTML and CSS code to be used as a todo starter for DGM 3760.

Some quick notes and things to think about when using this repo.
- This repo currently uses [ParcelJS](https://en.parceljs.org/getting_started.html)
- If you choose to keep and use Parcel to bundle and run your app, it is up to you to ensure you understand how it works and operates. Going over this tool in class is out of scope.
- You may choose to not keep and use Parcel. That is cool too, just note you will need to move the CSS from the js file to the HTML file.
- There is no HTML and CSS for todo categories or category management. This is up to you to implement.

Use this code at your own risk. ðŸ˜Ž
